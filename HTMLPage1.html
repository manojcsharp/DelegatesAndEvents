    Delegates vs. Interfaces
    Delegates and interfaces are similar in that they enable the separation of specification and implementation. Multiple independent authors can produce implementations that are compatible with an interface specification. Similarly, a delegate specifies the signature of a method, and authors can write methods that are compatible with the delegate specification. When should you use interfaces, and when should you use delegates?
    
    Delegates are useful when:
    A single method is being called.
    A class may want to have multiple implementations of the method specification.
    It is desirable to allow using a static method to implement the specification.
    An event-like design pattern is desired (for more information, see the Events Tutorial).
    The caller has no need to know or obtain the object that the method is defined on.
    The provider of the implementation wants to "hand out" the implementation of the specification to only a few select components.
    Easy composition is desired.
    
    Interfaces are useful when:
    The specification defines a set of related methods that will be called.
    A class typically implements the specification only once.
    The caller of the interface wants to cast to or from the interface type to obtain other interfaces or classes.
